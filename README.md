Pac-Man Game - Ex3 Algorithm ImplementationOverviewThis project implements an autonomous agent for the Pac-Man game as part of the Ex3 assignment. The core of the project is the Ex3Algo class, which calculates the optimal move for Pac-Man in real-time. The agent is designed to handle various game scenarios ranging from simple food collection to complex evasion and hunting strategies across multiple difficulty levels.The game supports 5 levels (0-4), where the difficulty and the number of ghosts scale with the level number.Game LevelsThe algorithm is tested against 5 distinct scenarios:Level 0: 0 Ghosts. A pure pathfinding challenge where the agent must collect all food pellets (Pink points) efficiently.Level 1: 1 Ghost. The agent must collect food while avoiding a single pursuer.Level 2: 2 Ghosts. Increased danger density.Level 3: 3 Ghosts. Requires careful navigation to avoid being trapped.Level 4: 4 Ghosts. Maximum difficulty with four active threats on the board.In all levels, the map acts as a cyclic world (Ex3P.GameInfo.CYCLIC_MODE), meaning boundaries wrap around (going off the left edge brings you to the right edge).Algorithm Logic (Ex3Algo)The decision-making process is implemented in Ex3Algo.java. The agent evaluates every possible move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) based on the current board state.Core StrategyThe algorithm follows a prioritized set of rules described below:Peaceful Mode (No Active Threats):If there are no monsters alive (or it is Level 0), the agent calculates the shortest path (using BFS allDistance) to the closest Pink point (food) and moves towards it.Danger Analysis & Evasion:If ghosts are present, the agent generates a Danger Map (DangerMaptonearest). This calculates the distance from every tile on the board to the nearest ghost.Critical Danger: If the minimum distance to any active monster is less than 7 steps:The agent evaluates all immediate neighbors.It selects the neighbor that maximizes the distance from the closest monster, effectively fleeing to safety.Power-Up Strategy (Green Points):The agent scans for Green points (power-ups) within a radius of 4 steps or less.It verifies safety: The shortest path to the Green point must be safe (distance to the point $\ge$ distance to the closest monster).If these conditions are met, the agent prioritizes moving to the Green point to turn the tables on the ghosts.Hunting Mode:If a monster is in an "eatable" state (after Pac-Man eats a Green point):The agent checks if the monster is reachable within the remaining eatable time.If reachable, the agent switches to hunting behavior and pursues the monster to eat it.Safety Rule: The agent is strictly programmed never to enter the Ghost House (the monsters' spawn area), even while hunting.Key Algorithm Functionsmove(PacmanGame game): The main loop. It parses the game state, builds the map, and scores every valid direction to choose the best one.DangerMaptonearest(...): Creates a 2D array representing the safety of the entire board by calculating distances to all active threats.evaluatedir(...): Assigns a numerical score to a potential move. It heavily penalizes moves that lead to tiles with a danger rating of < 2 or < 3 and rewards moves that lead to "safe spaces" or food.calculatSafeSpace(...): Uses BFS to count how many safe tiles are accessible from a given position, ensuring the agent doesn't run into a dead end.cheksneighbor(...): Helper function to determine coordinates of neighboring tiles, accounting for the cyclic map borders.Files DescriptionEx3Algo.java: The main algorithmic class implementing PacManAlgo.GameInfo.java: Configuration file containing constants like CYCLIC_MODE.Map.java: Helper class (assumed) for board representation and distance calculations (BFS).RunMyGame.java: (Optional) The main runner class to execute the game.
